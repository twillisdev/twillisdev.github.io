## What I'm working on currently
- a React app demonstrating (useState) and (useEffect)
- I'm also testing my tic tac toe app on various devices. I asked my classmates to test my website via their web browsers and mobile devices. 
They helped me find a bug really fast. The application wasn't rendering to their mobile devices properly. On a personal computer, the application worked perfectly, but on a mobile device the game board was distorted and looked more like a random Tetris brick stack than a tic tac toe board. I quickly resolved that by adjusting the px width x height of the border box.
- Deploying my applications on AWS
- Building MERN Stack mongodb, express, React, node

## Biggest Lesson Learned: 
If (my understanding of something is < 100%) { <br>
   console.log("Read the documentation!"); <br>
} else { <br>
   console.log("Watch the Youtube video tutorial, it will save me alot of time and frustration!"); <br>
   } <br>
   :wink:
   
## Looking forward to:
- working with classmates on a team project
- building so much cool stuff!
- contributing to my community as a citizen and as an engineer
