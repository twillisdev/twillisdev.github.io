## What I'm working on currently
- a React weather app (useState)
- I'm also testing my app on various devices. I asked my classmates to test my website via their web browsers and mobile devices. 
They helped me find a bug really fast. The application wasn't remdering to their mobile devises properly, so I adjusted the width x height of the border box.
