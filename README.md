## What I'm working on currently
- a React weather app (useState)
- I'm also testing my tic tac toe app on various devices. I asked my classmates to test my website via their web browsers and mobile devices. 
They helped me find a bug really fast. The application wasn't rendering to their mobile devices properly. On a personal computer, the application worked perfectly, but on a mobile device the game board was distorted and looked more like a random Tetris brick stack than a tic tac toe board. I quickly resolved that by adjusting the px width x height of the border box.
- Deploying my applications on Heroku

## Looking forward to working with classmates on a team project
