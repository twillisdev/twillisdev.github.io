## What I'm working on currently - January 2021
- Collaborating with Dev Ops React/Amplify frontend and AWS AppSync/DynamoDB GraphQL backend using VOD workflow for artists streaming video push to production
- Strengthening my foundational skills
- Gaining a full understanding, so that I can teach others

## What I was working on - December 2020
- a React app demonstrating (useState) and (useEffect), a little React native when I have time, playing with Expo cli which is soooooooo cool becasue of hot relaoding capability in real-time 
- Beta tested my tic tac toe app on various devices. I asked my classmates to test my website via their web browsers and mobile devices. 
They helped me find a bug really fast. The application wasn't rendering to their mobile devices properly. On a personal computer, the application worked perfectly, but on a mobile device the game board was distorted and looked more like a random Tetris brick stack than a tic tac toe board. I quickly resolved that by adjusting the px width x height of the border box.
- Deployed applications on AWS, Heroku
- Built Tinder Clone MERN Stack mongodb, express, Reactjs, node.js ðŸš€


## Biggest Lesson Learned: 
- in 2021: In the words of Elon Musk, "know your fundamentals at the base of your tree before focusing on the branches".
- in 2020:
If (my understanding of something is < 100%) { <br>
   console.log("Read the documentation!"); <br>
} else { <br>
   console.log("Watch the Youtube video tutorial, it will save me alot of time and frustration!"); <br>
   } <br>
   :wink:
   
## Looking forward to:
- successful collaboration with Dev Ops team
- working with classmates on a team project
- travel, having fun, building great realtionships, and building so much cool stuff!
- contributing to my community as a citizen and as an engineer
